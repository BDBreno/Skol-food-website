Skol.com is our food recipe website that we'll try to test out as much HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

stuff I want to do for the website:
- I want to make a user friendly website
- easy navigation
- 10 to 20 webpages
- use html as uniquly and effeciently as i can
- make the website user interactive, this is the main reason I'm making this website

websites we can reference for our website:
- https://www.epicurious.com/
- https://www.bonappetit.com/
- https://pinchofyum.com/
- https://food52.com/
- https://www.loveandlemons.com/
- https://www.allrecipes.com/ 
- https://www.recipetineats.com/
- https://www.thespruceeats.com/great-middle-eastern-sandwich-recipes-3958659 

Most of these websites have general similarities that we will use in our website, Skol.com
general things we'll use all the other websites have:
- a side or horizontal navigation bar, usually has a drop down navigation
- the pages Home, About, Recipes/Ingredients, Contact
- a search bar for food 
- small/slim footer, usually mirrored the navigation bar but in a different style
- home page that shows foods and recipes that link to other webpages
- some have video, I want to try to link other videos into the website and credit the video creators
- simple, striaght forward layout 

Details for our website: 
- needs a background image thats like a whole bunch of food but slightly blurred
- needs a list of 3 - 5 articles
- needs a slide show for videos that link to youtube pages
- nav needs to be user responsive 
- all text should be in a shadow box or overlaying an image so it can be easily read on the screen
